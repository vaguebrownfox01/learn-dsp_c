# 1
Analog to Digital Converter | ADC : Continuous signal to Discrete signal (samples).
Digital to Analog Converter | DAC : Discrete signal (samples) to Continuous signal.
Sample and Hold | S/H : Convert independent variable (e.g. x, time) from continuous to discrete.
Digitizer | Q : Convert dependent variable (e.g. y, voltage) from continuous to discrete.
ADC : S/H -> Q -> Discrete signal

# 2
Sampling frequency | fs : frequency at which the continuous signal is sampled.
Maximum frequency | fmax : Maximum frequency component that is present in the signal.
Sampling theorem: fs >= 2 * fmax
Aliasing: A frequency component (a sinusoid) assumes another frequency (other that its own value)
if fs < 2 * fmax : Aliasing happens
Low Pass Filter| LPF | Anti-aliasing filter : to remove frequency > 2 * fs
Digital Signal Processing | DSP
Analog signal -> LPF -> ADC -> DSP -> DAC -> Analog filter -> Processes analog signal

# 3
Analog filters: 3 types - optimize different performance parameters 
1. Bessel
2. Chebyshev
3. Butterworth

Simple filter: 
RC Passive LPF - passive: only passive components - Resistor | R and Capacitor | C
cut-off frequency | fc
Allow only frequency < fc
Circuit: R + C
Design: fc = 1 / (2 * pi * R * C)

High Pass Filter| HPF
RC Passive HPF
Allow only frequency > fc
Circuit: C + R

Ideal Filter : Passband + Stopband
Practical Filter : Passband + Transition + Stopband

Filter: More poles => More components => Better performance
More poles: Cascading Filters

Modified Sallen-Key Filter | MSKF - passive + active components (op-amp) - 2 poles
parameters: k1, k2 - decide resistor values
3 Stage MSKF (cascaded): 6 pole Bessel filter

# 4
Analog filter design : with MSKF cascading
3 types {B, C, B}:  Designed according to k1, k2 value from look-up table
cascaded to increase poles => better performance

# 5
Comparison 
1. Bessel: Best step-response; worst frequency response.
2. Chebyshev: Worst step-response; Best frequency response.
3. Butterworth: Meh step-response; Meh frequency response.

# 6
Information encoding
1. Time-domain encoding
2. Frequency-domain encoding

Audio signal: Information is present in the frequency component (sinusoids) present in the signal, more than the shape of the waveform.
Chebyshev and Butterworth: used as anti-aliasing filters; good performance because better roll off; bad step response doesn't affect much.
